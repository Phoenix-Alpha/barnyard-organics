### Where can I find your products?


As of 2017, all of our feed, grain, Bio-Ag and General Seed products can be ordered directly from the farm!  The minimum order for shipping is 1/2 tonne (1100 lbs / 20*25Kg of our feed/grain bags).  No minimum order if you are stopping by the farm, but do call ahead to make sure we'll be available and have your order ready for pick-up!


East Coast Organic Feed Mill products are also available at retail stores across the Maritimes (full list coming soon!), and our retail distribution is rapidly increasing!  Check with your local feed retailer and ask them to order in East Coast Organic Feed Mill products!


For chicken and eggs, you can purchase these directly from the farm depending on the season, but they are mostly available through Sally's Chicken & Egg CSA.


### Mash versus Pellet?
