<p>You can purchase frozen chicken from the farm while supplies last, but to be assured of a seasonal 100% organic poultry and/or egg supply, Sally offers her chicken and eggs through a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) bi-weekly delivery program.  Pick-up locations for the CSA are located in both Summerside and Charlottetown throughout the summer months.  Sign-ups for the CSA option are open in Spring of each year.</p>

<p>Eggs are available in the winter months through Soleilâ€™s Farm/Plate It CSA program or direct from the farm.<img src="/barnyard-organics/images/eggs-sol2-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
