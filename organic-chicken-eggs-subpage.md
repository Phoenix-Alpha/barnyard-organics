You can purchase frozen chicken from the farm while supplies last, but to be assured of a seasonal 100% organic poultry and/or egg supply, Sally offers her chicken and eggs through a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) bi-weekly delivery program.  Pick-up locations for the CSA are located in both Summerside and Charlottetown throughout the summer months.  Sign-ups for the CSA option are open in Spring of each year.


Eggs are available in the winter months through Soleilâ€™s Farm/[Plate It](http://www.justplateit.com/) CSA program or direct from the farm.

CSA Registration and Information can be found [here](https://goo.gl/forms/kqSpuXVzbWDlceFo1).
