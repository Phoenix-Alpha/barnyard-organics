description: 'Barnyard Organics have the enormous benefit of being able to produce
  all of their own organic grains and mix them themselves so they know exactly what
  is going into the feed and where it comes from, which lends a rare confidence to
  Barnyard Organics’ products that many others can’t guarantee.  '

## Chicken

You can purchase frozen chicken from the farm while supplies last, but to be assured of a seasonal 100% organic poultry and/or egg supply, Sally offers her chicken and eggs through a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) bi-weekly delivery program.  Pick-up locations for the CSA are located in both Summerside and Charlottetown throughout the summer months.  Sign-ups for the CSA option are open in Spring of each year.

## Organic, pasture-raised, happy poultry

Each year, when the spring is starting to welcome the warmth of summer, the brooding house at Barnyard Organics is filled with the sound of bundles of little chicks, all gathered under a warm light or huddled around the feeders.  At four weeks of age the chicks are moved from the brooding area to the pasture where they pick away at the grass and bugs while the summer sun warms their feathers.  The portable pasture shelters ensures that they get warm breezes, fresh grass and lots of exercise, everyday.
