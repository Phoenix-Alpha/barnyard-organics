## Wendell and Carol Anne


Wendell and Carol Anne took the farm over from Wendell’s parents, Donald and Amy, and made the leap from dairy production into the lucrative PEI potato industry as seed and table-stock producers.  They managed the farm until their ‘retirement’ in 2002, but Wendell has rarely gone a day without working on the farm since then. Both are a wealth of experience and support, never expressing doubt at the changes that have happened at the farm in the past 10 years, with Mark and Sally at the helm.

## Blain


Blain Ford came to Barnyard Organics in the midst of a summer when things felt like they were moving too fast and some things were getting missed.  Blain’s experience on a variety of farms and his quiet patience have made him an invaluable part of the Barnyard Organics farm family.  He’s a significant part of the East Coast Organic Feed Mill, handling much of the mixing and milling, but is also important to the livestock side of the farm, having a truly innate sense of animal care and husbandry.
