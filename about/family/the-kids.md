description: One of the important values of the farm is the purposeful inclusion of
  the kids into the operation. Each has their own very individual interests and skills
  and we love watching their contributions change and grow each year.

## Lucy

<img class="image left" src="/images/hog-lucy2-1.jpg"> <blockquote>I am 9 years old and I run a business called, “Lucy’s Offal Good Business” and I make dog treats from the hearts and livers of our chickens.  I sell them at Mom’s CSA pick ups, but if you want to order some, email Mom.  I like to do the pasture chores and help out anywhere around the farm.  My favorite part of the farm is my pony, Sofia.  </blockquote>

<blockquote>I am 8 years old and I like to help out on the farm with the chickens, in the summer.  I sell chicken feet for some people to make broth with.  My favorite part of being on a farm is the bumpy ride on the 4 wheeler, heading out to the pasture.</blockquote>

The youngest of the brood is 3 years old and shows great promise on the heavy lifting of things at the farm.  Always up for an adventure, Sol will not be left behind anything going on, particularly if his siblings are involved.
