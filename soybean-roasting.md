### Barnyard Organics is pleased to be able to offer custom soybean roasting for organic farmers in a dedicated organic and non-GMO facility.  Soybean roasting service is available year-round, with the busiest season taking place after harvest in October/November.

***Why Roast?***

Soybeans, although an excellent source of protein, contain an enzyme which acts as an inhibitor, preventing some of the protein from being released when consumed.  Roasting is the process which removes the enzyme, allowing the cow, for example, to retain all the nutrients from the bean.  Roasting soybeans is a necessary process for feed for cattle, sheep, pigs and many other animals that consume them as a part of their diet ensuring the highest quality and highest nutrient availability of the bean.![](/barnyard-organics/images/soybeans-and-sol-SMALL-1.JPG)
