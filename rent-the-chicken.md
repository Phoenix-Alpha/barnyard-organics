### Have you considered starting your own backyard flock?  Do you like fresh eggs and watching a hen enjoy life?  Are you a city-dweller who longs for a bit of the farm life, but maybe wants to try it out before investing the money in birds, a coop, feed, etc?

\*Rent The Chicken *provides all of the supplies you need to enjoy a summer life with laying hens including:

* portable chicken coop;
* two or four egg laying hens;
* certified organic, locally-grown feed;
* food & water dishes;
* instructions on how to keep your chickens happy!

Within two days of the arrival, your chickens will lay eggs ready to use!  These eggs have 1/3 less cholesterol, 1/4 less saturated fats, and 2 times more omega 3 fatty acids than store bought eggs.  Your Rent The Chickens should lay 8-14 or 16-28 eggs per week depending on your Rental Package.  You will know exactly what your chickens eat!

How does it work?  We schedule a date to bring to your home a portable coop, two or four chickens that are already laying eggs, and the supplies needed for your rental period.  Chickens produce the most eggs when daylight is at peak. Towards the end of the Rental Period, if you realize that you were born to raise backyard chickens, adopting the chickens and all of their supplies is an option! Otherwise, we will schedule a date towards the end of your Rental to stop by and pick up the rented chickens, coop and supplies.
