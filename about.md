  description: "Barnyard Organics is a certified organic farm, begun in 2003, where
    a vision for a self-sustaining and environmentally sustainable farm continues
    to be the goal. \n\nBarnyard Organics is located in Freetown, PEI Canada, where
    Mark and Sally like to say they are the buckle of the potato belt. Having started
    as a traditional mixed farm, proceeding generations switched to a dairy focus,
    then to potatoes, and the current generation aims to bring the farm back to its
    original state as a self-sustaining mixed farm, using traditional methods combined
    with some of the efficient technologies of our time.\n\nGrowing, mixing and selling
    complete organic feed rations for livestock, selling bulk organic grains, custom
    seed cleaning and soybean roasting, managing a Community Shared Agriculture program
    for organic chicken and eggs, custom poultry processing and raising four enthusiastic
    farm kids keeps everyone pretty busy.  \n\nVisitors are welcome to the farm anytime,
    although it is wise to ensure we will be available, as it can be a busy place
    most of the year!\n\nThanks to Wendell and Carol Anne and to our farm tech, Blain,
    we are able to focus on our priority of soil health above all else.  \n\nSally
    & Mark Bernard"
