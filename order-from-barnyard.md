### BULK BUYING CLUB

We also love to support informal bulk buying! 

The bulk buying club model allows customers living in proximity to enjoy cost-savings by pooling their orders to benefit from significantly reduced shipping rates!

Here's how you can volunteer to coordinate a bulk buying club:

* Email, use social media, or call your fellow farming/backyard livestock buddies who are located in your general area who might be interested in placing an order with Barnyard Organics/East Coast Organic Grainery.
* Copy, rename, and send out /share Barnyard Organics' Google Price & Product Spreadsheet to everyone who wants to participate in the bulk buying club order, being sure to specify a date when all orders must be submitted.
* Decide on a HOST. The Host will be the location where the order is shipped and where the bulk buying club participants will pick-up their order. Sometimes the Host is the coordinator, other times, they are two separate volunteer roles.

The ideal Host: Has the capacity to unload a multi-tonne order (i.e. a forklift), (not necessary, but will save significantly on tailgate delivery fees); Is happy to invite participants to their home to pick-up the order; Is able to easily contact participants; Has the capacity to store any orders that are not picked up at the designated time; Is happy to help organize and distribute the order to the participants as they arrive during the designated pick-up time (ideally assisted by the volunteer coordinator);

The Host duties are: Provide pick-up point address and phone number to order participants; Help \[the coordinator\] divvy up the orders.

Be available during the shipment drop-off date/time for an approximately one-hour time slot where everyone will pick-up their orders; Potentially hang-on to orders for folks who are unable to make the pick-up time; Help spread the word to encourage more customers to take advantage of the opportunity to work together to save money!

* The spreadsheet will automatically add up the individual totals in each orderâ€™s spreadsheet tab, as well as a complete tally into the Master Order Sheet. From here, you can easily place your order by emailing Barnyard Organics with the Google Spreadsheet Master Order Sheet.

Please note that the minimum shipment required for a Buying Club model to work is 1 tonne / 40*25Kg bags / 2200 lbs. There is no maximum! Indeed, the more you and your friends order, the more cost savings you'll reap!
