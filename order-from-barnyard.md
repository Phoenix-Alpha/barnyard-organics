### BULK BUYING CLUB

We also love to hear about and support informal bulk buying!  The bulk buying club model is one that allows customers to enjoy cost-savings by pooling their orders to benefit from reduced shipping rates.

Here's how you can volunteer to coordinate an bulk buying club:



* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Email, use social media, or call your fellow farming/backyard livestock buddies who are located in your general area who might be interested in placing an order with Barnyard Organics/East Coast Organic Feed Mill. &nbsp;</span>
* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Copy, rename, and send out /share Barnyard Organics' Google Price &amp; Product Spreadsheet </span>*(COMING SOON!)*<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> to everyone who wants to participate in the bulk buying club order, being sure to specify a date when all orders must be submitted.</span>
* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Decide on a HOST. &nbsp;The Host will be the location where the order is shipped and where the bulk buying club participants will pick-up their order. &nbsp;Sometimes the Host is the coordinator,&nbsp;</span>other times<span style="font-size: 1rem;">, they are two separate volunteer roles.</span>



<blockquote>The ideal Host:<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Has the capacity to unload a multi-tonne order (i.e. a forklift), (not necessary, but will save significantly on tailgate delivery fees);<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Is happy to invite participants to their home to pick-up the order;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Is able to easily contact participants&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Has the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">capacity to</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;store any orders that are not picked up at the designated time;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Is happy to help organize and distribute the order to the participants as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">they</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;arrive during the designated pick-up time (ideally assisted by the volunteer coordinator)<br></span>The Host duties are:<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Provide pick-up point address and phone number to order participants;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Help [the coordinator] divvy up the orders according to the Google Spreadsheet;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Be available during&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the shipment</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;drop-off date/time for an approximately one-hour&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">time slot</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;where everyone will pick-up their orders;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Potentially hang-on to orders for folks who are unable to make the pick-up time;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Help spread the word to encourage more customers to take advantage of the opportunity to work together to save money!</span></blockquote>



* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The spreadsheet will automatically add up the totals. &nbsp;You can place your order either using East Coast Organic's </span><a href="linkhere" style="font-size: 1rem;">online order form</a>* (COMING SOON!), *<span style="font-size: 1rem;">or by emailing Barnyard Organics with your Google Spreadsheet. &nbsp;</span>



The minimum shipment required for a Buying Club model to work is 1 tonne / 40*25Kg bags / 2200 lbs.  There is no maximum!  Indeed, the more you and your friends order, the more cost savings you'll reap!

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Host duties:</span>



CONSIDERATIONS:  What’s needed to help encourage current BYO customers to consider a Buying Club (pooling their shipments?)

Volumes for the average participant?  If one participant wants more than one pallet, should be delivered directly to the farm for ease of pick-up … (otherwise need a forklift?)

Number of participants ordering enough volume to fill a pallet or two to take advantage of cost-savings …
