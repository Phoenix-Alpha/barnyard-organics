## <span style="font-size: 1rem;"><b>Grain Milling for Livestock Feed</b></span>

Barnyard Organics has invested in a hammer mill to process grains for livestock feed.  The hammer mill allows flexibility in the consistency of the final product––from a fine mash to a coarse grind.

Mark Bernard is happy to consult with customers about the best grind for their milling needs.
